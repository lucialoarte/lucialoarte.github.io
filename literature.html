         <h3>this is another poem , it is written by shakespeare and I had to read it in the play we did next year:</h3>
         <p>
            <strong>All the world’s a <em>stage</em>,</strong><br>
And all the men and women merely players; <br>
They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages. <br>
At first the infant,<br>
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,<br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;<br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything</p>
